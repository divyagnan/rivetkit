While actors can serve as a complete database solution, they can also complement your existing databases. For example, you might use actors to handle frequently-changing data that needs real-time access, while keeping less frequently accessed data in your traditional database.

Actors can be used with common SQL databases, such as PostgreSQL and MySQL.

## Libraries

To facilitate interaction with SQL databases, you can use either ORM libraries or raw SQL drivers. Each has its own use cases and benefits:

-   **ORM Libraries**: Type-safe and easy way to interact with your database

    -   [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/)
    -   [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)

-   **Raw SQL Drivers**: Direct access to the database for more flexibility

    -   [PostgreSQL](https://node-postgres.com/)
    -   [MySQL](https://github.com/mysqljs/mysql)

## Hosting Providers

There are several options for places to host your SQL database:

-   [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)
-   [Neon](https://neon.tech/)
-   [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/)
-   [AWS RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/)
-   [Google Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql)

## Example

Here's a basic example of how you might set up a connection to a PostgreSQL database using Drizzle:

```typescript actor.ts
import { Actor, type Rpc } from "actor-core";
import { Pool } from "pg";

export default class DatabaseActor extends Actor {
	#pool: Pool;

	constructor() {
		super();

		this.#pool = new Pool({
			user: "your_db_user",
			host: "localhost",
			database: "your_db_name",
			password: "your_db_password",
			port: 5432,
		});
	}

	// Example RPC to fetch data from database
	async fetchData(rpc: Rpc<DatabaseActor>) {
		try {
			const result = await this.#pool.query("SELECT * FROM your_table");
			return result.rows;
		} catch (error) {
			console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
			throw new Error("Failed to fetch data");
		}
	}

	// Example RPC to insert data into database
	async insertData(rpc: Rpc<DatabaseActor>, data: any) {
		try {
			await this.#pool.query("INSERT INTO your_table (column1, column2) VALUES ($1, $2)", [
				data.value1,
				data.value2,
			]);
			return { success: true };
		} catch (error) {
			console.error("Error inserting data:", error);
			throw new Error("Failed to insert data");
		}
	}
}
```
